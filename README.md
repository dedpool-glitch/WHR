# WORLD HAPPINESS REPORT
This is my first project approaching towards the field of Data Science. I am performing an Exploratory Data Analysis on World Happiness Reports for 3 different years. As these reports have been generated in the past 5 years, I have chosen datasets corresponding to the results only for 3 alternate years, 2015,2017,2019, for relevant analysis. 
   I will be formulating questions on my own and answer them using visualisations and statistics. Analysis being done in Python3 and I am using a Kaggle Notebook. The link to the dataset has been uploaded in the repository "WHR"
