How is GDP related to Happiness Score?\n\nFrom the heatmaps,Correlation coefficient between GDP_per_capita and Score is ~ 0.79 in all the 3 years indicating a strong positive relationship between the satisfaction of citizens with the GDP and the Happiness score. GDP_per capita is a tracker of the economic growth of a country. People in countries showing positive growth rate of economies tend to be more happier as it leads to higher incomes and better standards of living. Hence, we conclude that the GDP of a country should be one of the top priorities to ensure satisfaction.\n\n2. Relation of Freedom to Happiness Score?\n\nThe correlation coefficient between Freedom and Score is exactly 0.57 in all 3 years indicating a moderately positive relationship between the perception of Freedom and the Happiness Score of a country. Generalising this perception of freedom is a hard task because according to [research](https://globescan.com/a-deeper-look-at-freedom-how-perceptions-differ-across-countries-and-groups/) it is different for people belonging to different parts of the world. Nevertheless, it is still a significant contributor to the Happiness Score of a nation.  \n\n\n3.

About 20% of people in the country do not have access to clean water source, which consequently also leads to spread of diseases.\n\n* **Unhygienic living conditions**: Lesotho has a very high mortality rate. This is attributed to poor living conditions and the extreme poverty in which majority of the population of Lesotho lives. Inaccessibility to healthcare facilities renders these people helpless.\n\n* **Inadequate source of healthy foods**: Agricultural land covers an extremely small part of Lesotho.

Fees of secondary schools are in talks to be lowered as a majority of the people cannot afford to pay it.
